The easiest way you can make your websites `footer` stick to the bottom of the page no matter what the height of your webpage is to use CSS `flexbox`.

This is our example `HTML` webpage's code:

```html
<header>
  <h1>HEADER TITLE</h1>
  <h2>Subtitle</h2>
</header>

<div class="content">
  <h1>Content Title</h1>
  <p>
    Lorem ipsum dolor sit, amet consectetur adipisicing elit. Necessitatibus
    incidunt explicabo error, maxime reiciendis consectetur sapiente velit
    perspiciatis, quibusdam enim facere praesentium vitae alias dignissimos
    debitis impedit sequi, assumenda ipsa.
  </p>
</div>

<footer>
  <h3>Created By Shafi</h3>
  <p>&copy; 2020</p>
</footer>
```

We've connected our stylesheet with this page and stripped down the default styling by using this CSS Snippet

```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
  box-sizing: border-box;
  font-family: monospace;
}
```

At this moment our webpage looks like this:

To take our `footer` element to the bottom of the page, we're going to use our `body` element as a **flex container**. All the children of body will thus turn into individual flex items.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 100vh;
}
```

Here, using the `display: flex` turned our `body` element into a flex container.

> The flex-direction property specifies the direction of the flexible items.
> We set `flex-direction`s property as `column`. Thus all the children of body will flow from top to bottom.

And we set a `min-height` property on our page so that no matter what the contents length is, the body height will at least equals to the screen size.

Well, the CSS didn't do much to our webpage, did it?

Worry not! We'd only need one more line of code to set our footer to the bottom of the screen.

```css
.content {
  flex: 1;
}
```

> The `flex` property is a shorthand property for:

- `flex-grow`
- `flex-shrink`
- `flex-basis`

> The `flex` property sets the flexible length on flexible items.

This tells our `content div` to take all the available unused space.

Our webpage now looks like this!

Cheers ðŸŽ‰

Now if we want to center all the contents inside of our `content div`, we can just turn it into a **flex container** like this

```css
.content {
  flex: 1;
  /* CENTER EVERYTHING VERTICALLY */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

And now the end result looks like this
